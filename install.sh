# It will ask for the panel URL, join token and optional node domain. Arguments
# go through to deploy/install-node.sh after `-s --` for unattended install or
# maintenance:
#
#   ... | sh -s -- --panel https://panel.example.com --token <token>
#   ... | sh -s -- --version      node and sing-box versions
#   ... | sh -s -- --upgrade      rebuild and restart, sing-box core included
#   ... | sh -s -- --uninstall    remove the service; keep the certificate
#   ... | sh -s -- --purge        remove everything this installer created
#
# This file exists only to fetch the sources and hand over. Everything real is
# in deploy/install-node.sh, which is worth reading before running either.
